# MAGD-150-Assignments

Lab 01 was very simple. All we had to do was make a house in black and white using the basic shapes made with Processing. Said shapes included Rectangles, Ellipses, Lines, and Points.

Lab 03 was about designing an animated screensaver. I basically used some random basic shapes to experiment with the animated features of Processing. These features included mousePressed(), mouseX and mouseY, frameRate(), and xspeed.

Lab 04 was about making interactive movement or animation in Processing. For this project, I made a large, orange circle in front of a background consisting of a gride of small, red circles. The large circle could be moved around using the WASD arrow keys, and if the right mouse button is pressed, the circles switch colors.

Lab 08 was about adding text and fonts to our Processing sketches, and the theme was to make a movie poster that featured at least two different fonts and had animated text somewhere. I made a dark poster titled "Half/Blood", with a red yin-yang symbol in the center with a pair of scary eyes just below it. At the top is the credits for the movie and the title was underneath both the yin-yang symbol and the eyes, and is constantly shaking with fear. The assignment wanted us to save the poster as a pdf, but I was unable to get it to work.

Lab 09 was about adding audio and video in our sketches, and the theme was to make a Processing sketch that had to do with a documentary somehow. For this project, I made a looped clip of a cat on a small TV screen, with a clock set to 9:00 in the upper left-hand corner and a poster for "Why Cats Are So Cute!!" documentary playing at 9. There is ukulele music playing in the background(presumably coming from the TV) that can have its volume raised or lowered depending on which mouse button the viewer presses. I got a kick out of making the poster, which is full of funny little details that can't be seen easily in the Processing sketch.
